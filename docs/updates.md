## Changes to the Requirements Document

For the requirements document we added the changes and revisions that you recommended to us in our feedback. That includes changing around the structure to make it more reader friendly. Moving the UI to before talking about the games and adding a part on the pen world before the games as well. We also added some descriptions to the sections before going into lists to make it easier to follow. There are also some added discussions to the casino hub in the product features. In regards to your feedback for the UI, in each game we have a separate UI section for each game's requirements, due to each game having its own needs and desires for its interface. We also added some clarity on how betting will work in the games, with explaining limits and what happens when the player runs out of money. The betting limits are stated within each game's “Gameplay” section. We go over what happens if they run out of money in its own features section. We also explained the random number generator for slots, and fixed the dice UI design points error.

## Changes to the Standards Document

We made several updates to the Team Standards and Processes document. Introductory sentences were added to each section to improve clarity and readability. The Documentation standards and processes section was updated to clarify that it focuses on project-related documents (e.g., Charter, Proposal, Design) rather than code documentation, and we specified that the team uses Google Docs and Google Drive for collaboration, allowing team members to work together or have specific sections assigned to individuals. Code documentation practices were moved to the Coding standards and processes section, along with the addition of clearer guidelines on pull requests, where the Git Lead is now responsible for handling reviews and merges. The version control section was also expanded to include the role of the Git Lead in overseeing repository health, with emphasis on using a consistent commit message format and semantic versioning for releases. Oleksii Zhukov was assigned as a Git Lead.
